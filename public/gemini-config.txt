Analyze the following image of a receipt. Return only a 
JSON array where each element is an object representing 
an item in the following format:

{
  "name": "string",
  "price": 0.0,
  "people": [false, false, ...]
}

1. name should be the exact item name from the receipt.
2. price should be the numeric value of the item.
3. people should be an array of false values, one for 
    each person (assume 2 people for example if not specified).

Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown—just return the JSON array.
If the image is not a reciept or cannot be read at all, return "Cannot Read Image".
