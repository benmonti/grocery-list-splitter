Analyze the following image of a receipt. Return only a 
JSON array where each element is an object representing 
an item in the following format:

{
  "name": "string",
  "price": 0.0,
  "people": [false, false, ...]
}

1. name should be the exact item name from the receipt.
2. price should be the numeric value of the item minus any discounts.
3. people should be an array of false values, one for 
    each person (assume 2 people for example if not specified).

Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown—just return the JSON array.
If the image is not a reciept or cannot be read at all, return "Cannot Read Image".

Use generic names, especially for long or abbreviated names.
Use info from stores and their databases.
Ex. chrmn ess str 6mr sp m -> Charmin Essentials Strong 6 Mega Rolls -> Toilet Paper
Ex. Downy Ultra Liquid Fabric Conditioner -> Fabric Softener
Ex. Kirkland Signature Meatballs -> Meatballs

Make it as generic as possible without losing it's meaning.

Object should be a parseable json without any extra words, characters, spaces, etc.
The exact format of the response should be:

[
  {
    "name": "string",
    "price": number,
    "people": [boolean, boolean]
  },
  {
    "name": "string",
    "price": number,
    "people": [boolean, boolean]
  },
  {
    "name": "string",
    "price": number,
    "people": [boolean, boolean]
  },
  {
    "name": "string",
    "price": number,
    "people": [boolean, boolean]
  }
]
